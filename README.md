# 1. Back story & purpose of the game:
So basically, the story of the game goes like this, our main player who the players will play as
is wrongfully fired from the company where he worked at his whole life. With that indignation
he decides to launch his own tech company with all the severance payment that he was given
and with one ambition and goal in his mind to become the most valuable company out there
and to run his old company obsolete. As mentioned, the purpose in the game is to become the
most valuable company in the stock market.
# 2. How to play:
Here we will concisely describe in verbal form on how to play the game later in the Panel
section all the available windows, options, and actions that user can take will be displayed using
screenshots (refer to page no:). So, when logged into the game player can see whole bunch of
panels down below such as the stock panel, employee pane etc. and some panels are comprised
of sub panels which presented when users click on them. Moreover, above the screen there are
some indicators for instance time, money, and date. So, there are whole bunch of things users
can do within the game keeping in mind the ultimate goal and for that user will have take on
contract work, built their own software, hire new employees, buy furniture, and increment their
employeeâ€™s skill level. Since each action has varying consequences, user will have to think
strategically on how to make their next move. So basically, players are in charge of how soon
to reach the ultimate goal depending on their decision and moves.
